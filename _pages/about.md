About Me
=====

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, having started my studies in 2024. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Vijay Ganesh](https://vganesh1.github.io). Before pursuing my PhD, I completed my bachelor's degree at Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate studies, I also had the opportunity to work with Prof. [Huajie Shao](https://shj1987.github.io), who provided me with significant assistance.

My research focuses on applying advanced AI methods to solve complex problems in physics. While my expertise isn't in physics itself, my goal is to leverage AI’s computational power to model real-world reasoning and tackle sophisticated challenges. I'm currently working on symbolic regression, a technique that aims to uncover underlying equations from data and domain knowledge. Through this, I'm exploring how AI can emulate the thinking process of physicists, while also taking advantage of its unique strengths in computation. I believe that these innovations in AI will shape the future in remarkable ways.


How to Call Me
=====

Just call me "Creatix", my nickname for most of my account IDs. You can pronounce it in any way you like. My Chinese name is "褚写庭", and if written in Pinyin, it is "Chu Xieting". My last name is "褚" or "Chu", pronounced like "true"; my first name is "写庭" or "Xieting", pronounced like "citing".
