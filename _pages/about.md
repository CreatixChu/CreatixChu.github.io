About Me
=====
I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, beginning my studies in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. Vijay Ganesh. Before PhD, I completed my bachelor's degree at Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University. 

My research interest lie in developing logical machine learning tools to advance scientific discovery.


How to Call Me
=====

Just call me "Creatix", my nickname for most of my account IDs. You can pronounce it in any way you like. My Chinese name is "褚写庭", and if written in Pinyin, it is "Chu Xieting". My last name is "褚" or "Chu", pronounced like "true"; my first name is "写庭" or "Xieting", pronounced like "citing".
