About Me
=====

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, having started my studies in 2024. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Vijay Ganesh](https://vganesh1.github.io). Before pursuing my PhD, I completed my bachelor's degree at Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University. During my undergraduate studies, I also had the opportunity to work with Prof. [Huajie Shao](https://shj1987.github.io), who provided me with significant assistance.

My research interest lie in developing logical machine learning tools to advance scientific discovery.


How to Call Me
=====

Just call me "Creatix", my nickname for most of my account IDs. You can pronounce it in any way you like. My Chinese name is "褚写庭", and if written in Pinyin, it is "Chu Xieting". My last name is "褚" or "Chu", pronounced like "true"; my first name is "写庭" or "Xieting", pronounced like "citing".
